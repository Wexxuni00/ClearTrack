## Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** Angular + TypeScript + RxJS + Angular Material / TailwindCSS  
- **Backend:** Java Microservices (Spring Boot) with REST APIs  
- **Database:** PostgreSQL or MySQL  
- **Realtime Updates:** WebSocket or SSE for live dashboard changes  
- **Authentication:** OAuth2 / JWT with role-based access  
- **Testing:** Jest & Jasmine (frontend), JUnit & Mockito (backend)  
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions or Jenkins with Docker containerization  

## How It Works
1. **Data Ingestion:** Personnel, clearance, and training data are collected from HR systems, LMS platforms, or manual entry.  
2. **Backend Processing:** Microservices handle validation, update status, and compute readiness metrics.  
3. **Real-Time Updates:** Frontend subscribes to WebSocket streams for instant dashboard updates when personnel data changes.  
4. **Reporting:** Admins generate reports for units or departments to monitor compliance and readiness.  
5. **Access Control:** User roles determine which datasets and features are accessible, ensuring security and compliance.  

## Use Cases
- **Military Units:** Track personnel deployment readiness, certifications, and clearances.  
- **Government Agencies:** Monitor sensitive clearance levels and mandatory training across teams.  
- **Training Organizations:** Verify completion rates and schedule retraining sessions.  
- **Leadership Dashboards:** Enable commanders and managers to make informed decisions about readiness and staffing.  

## Security & Compliance
- TLS 1.3 for secure data transmission.  
- Role-based access control to enforce least-privilege access.  
- Audit logging for all sensitive actions and data changes.  
- Data encryption at rest and in transit using standard cryptographic protocols.  
- Compliance with federal standards for personnel and clearance data.  

## Future Enhancements
- Integration with additional HR and LMS APIs for automated updates.  
- AI-driven readiness prediction and trend analytics.  
- Mobile-optimized frontend with offline caching.  
- Notification system for expiring certifications or clearance renewals.  
- Enhanced reporting with interactive dashboards for executive oversight.
